A function that is passed to another function as an argument to another function, which is called within an external function to complete some kind of routine or action.

ex.: https://replit.com/@beatrizoliveiir/ex-callback-ts

```tsx
interface definitionInterface {
  (message: string): void;
}

const greeting = (message: string) => console.log(`Hello ${message}`);

const sayHello = (callback: definitionInterface) => {
  callback('World!');
};
sayHello(greeting);
```

The example above is of a **synchronous callback**, since it is executed immediately.

</div>
