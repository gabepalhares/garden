Hi, welcome to my `digital garden`! My name is `Gabriel Palhares`, also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/minortypo" target="_blank">minortypo</a>. You might have seen me online with a Shiba profile pic â€” `I just love Shibas!` I actively engage in the concept of <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/" target="_blank">Learn in Public</a> by sharing my knowledge through articles and code. This webpage is one of my ways of doing that. `g.arden` was created based on the `Zettelkasten` idea, inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/sseraphini" target="_blank">Sibelius</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/biantris_" target="_blank">Biantris</a> and their versions. My aim is to consistently update this space with everything I'm studying, learning, and developing.
