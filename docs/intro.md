Hi, welcome to my `Zettelkasten!` My name is <a href="https://x.com/gabepalhares" target="_blank">Gabriel</a>, also known as `Palhares`. You might have seen this Shiba profile pic somewhere — it's just that `I love Shibas` and wanted to make them part of my personal brand!

I actively engage in the concept of <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/" target="_blank">Learn in Public</a> by sharing my knowledge through articles and code. This webpage is one of my ways of doing that.

`g.arden` was created, inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/sseraphini" target="_blank">Sibelius</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/biantris_" target="_blank">Biantris</a>. After seeing their amazing versions, I wanted a space like theirs — a second brain on the web. My goal is to consistently update this space with everything I'm studying, learning, and coding.
