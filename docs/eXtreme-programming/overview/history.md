Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development methodology created by Kent Beck in the 1990s. The history of XP dates back to the late 1990s when Beck, along with other developers, began developing and refining this approach.

Here is a brief timeline and some important milestones in the history of XP:

**Early 1990s:** Kent Beck worked on software development projects and began developing practices and concepts that would later form the basis of XP. He published his book "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns," which included some precursor ideas.

**1996:** Kent Beck published the book "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change," which officially introduced the Extreme Programming methodology to the world. The book described the fundamental principles of XP, such as short iterations, test-driven development, pair programming, and others.

**1999:** The XP methodology began to gain acceptance and popularity, particularly among software development teams facing common challenges such as frequent requirement changes and unsatisfactory software quality.

**Early 2000s:** The agile software development community grew and expanded, with XP becoming one of several widely adopted agile approaches.

**Continuous Evolution:** XP has evolved over the years with contributions from developers and additional practices such as continuous integration, test-driven design, and other agile concepts.

**Global Adoption:** The XP methodology has been adopted worldwide by software development teams across various industries and contexts.

XP was one of the first agile methodologies to be formally defined and publicized, influencing the subsequent development of other agile approaches such as Scrum and Kanban. XPâ€™s emphasis on simplicity, effective communication, and adaptability to change has contributed to its enduring popularity in the field of agile software development. Although the methodology has evolved and adapted over time, its core principles remain relevant to development teams seeking efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.
