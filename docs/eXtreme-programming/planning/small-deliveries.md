*'Working software is the primary measure of progress.' - 7th principle of the Agile Manifesto*

**Why keep the client waiting** a long time to deliver an important requirement? In XP, each release should be as small as possible while delivering the maximum business value.

**Small deliveries** contain the user stories identified and prioritized in the planning game.

### Advantages of Small Deliveries:

- Early and Continuous Value Delivery: Provides value to the client sooner and more frequently.
- Improved Process Through Fail Fast Concept: Allows for quick failure and improvement, accelerating the refinement process.
- Higher Quality, Confidence, and Stability: Promotes a higher standard of quality and reliability.
- Simplified and Sufficient Design: Focuses on a design that is just enough for the current delivery.
- More Frequent Code Updates and Integration: Ensures code is updated and integrated regularly, reducing integration issues.
- Increased Team Engagement: Allows the team to see their work being utilized and fosters a sense of empowerment.
