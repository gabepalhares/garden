*"Although there are countless ways to communicate ideas, some are more effective than others."*

A team practicing Extreme Programming prioritizes communication at all times. Communication is not solely defined by speech; it involves various elements beyond it. The greater the understanding between the parties communicating, the higher the chances of avoiding problems, ambiguities, or misunderstandings. The more robust the communication, the fewer these issues will be.
