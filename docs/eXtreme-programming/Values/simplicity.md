*"Many teams are accustomed to the practice of futurology, suffering from Nostradamus Syndrome."*

The tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto is: **"Simplicity: the art of maximizing the amount of work not done."**

- Simplicity is valued in XP as a way to keep the software manageable and easy to maintain.
- XP teams strive for the simplest solution that meets the client's requirements. This involves avoiding excessive engineering and unnecessary complexity.
- Keeping the code simple facilitates understanding, maintenance, and the evolution of the software over time.

By keeping a project simple, we ensure that the most important aspects are developed. Simplicity forces us to focus on what truly matters and to add more value.
