According to the second principle of the Agile Manifesto: **"Changes in requirements are welcome, even late in development."**

The sooner we receive feedback, the sooner we can act and correct potential issues. In the adoption of practices, feedback is constant, whether regarding client requirements or the code itself.

- Feedback is considered crucial in XP to ensure that the team is on the right track and to enable continuous adaptation.
- XP teams collect feedback from clients through incremental and frequent deliveries. This allows clients to see progress and make adjustments to requirements as the project advances.
- Feedback is also obtained through automated testing, code reviews, and regular team retrospectives to improve the development process.
