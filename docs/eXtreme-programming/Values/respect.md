**"People who are respected feel valued."**

Some of XPâ€™s principles are humanity and diversity. Respect must always prevail among the team and towards the client. This allows all other principles to be implemented through practices.

- Respect in XP involves treating everyone involved in the project with consideration and dignity.
- This includes respecting the opinions and needs of clients, team members, and other stakeholders.
- XP values collaboration and mutual trust, which is promoted through respect for different perspectives and working together.

Respect is a crucial factor in XP, providing a foundation for all other values and ensuring that the project evolves in a healthy manner.
