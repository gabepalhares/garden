Should a junior developer refactor code written by a senior developer?

Several XP practices provide the means for this. Practices should offer the assurance that only courage is needed to make improvements to the system. Courage becomes even more essential during times of crisis.

- In XP, courage refers to the team's willingness to face challenges such as changes in requirements, technical obstacles, and project risks.
- XP teams have the courage to make tough decisions, including rejecting unnecessary features and accepting last-minute changes.
- Courage is necessary to maintain software quality, even if it means rework, and to be transparent about the problems and challenges faced.

**"Courage and the attitude to implement what needs to be implemented and to do what needs to be done."**
