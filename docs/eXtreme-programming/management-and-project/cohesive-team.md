First value of the Agile Manifesto: **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

**In a project,** everyone is part of the team, and the team is a unit. A cohesive group will possess all the business and technical skills needed to develop the software.

Characteristics of a Cohesive Team:

- Multidisciplinary
- Self-organizing
- Close-knit
- Continuous improvement

**Teamwork:** A cohesive team in XP operates as a unified unit. Team members share responsibilities and actively collaborate on project tasks. They do not work in isolation but as a unified group.

**Open Communication:** Communication is a critical element of team cohesion. XP team members communicate openly and frequently, sharing information, challenges, and solutions. Daily stand-up meetings are a common practice in XP to maintain constant communication.

**Shared Responsibility:** In a cohesive XP team, the responsibility for the success of the project is shared by all team members. This includes not only developers but also testers, designers, clients, and others.

**Mutual Trust:** Trust between team members is fundamental to cohesion. The team trusts each other's skills and commitment, which facilitates effective collaboration and decision-making.

**Flexibility and Adaptation:** A cohesive XP team is flexible and able to adapt to changes in requirements, priorities, and project challenges. The team is willing to adjust its course and embrace change as part of the process.

**Commitment to Quality:** Team cohesion is linked to a commitment to quality. XP team members share the goal of delivering high-quality software and are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve it.

**Continuous Learning:** A cohesive XP team is always seeking learning and improvement. This involves holding regular retrospectives to identify areas for enhancement and implementing changes in the development process.
