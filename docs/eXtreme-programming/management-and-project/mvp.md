*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - Leonardo da Vinci*

**Attempting to predict** the future is anti-XP. Trying to foresee the future means "overcomplicating" with futurology, as you try to guess what will be needed, leading to the Nostradamus Syndrome. No additional features are implemented, as they deviate from the solution path and increase the complexity of the software.

**Having a simple project** is essential for creating an MVP. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) contains the most valuable features in the smallest possible delivery, being sufficient for the client to use and provide feedback on the development.

**The MVP is a practice** involving the creation of the simplest version of the software that meets the client's needs. This allows for quick deliveries, immediate feedback, and incremental improvements over time, making it compatible with short XP iterations and enhancing customer satisfaction.
