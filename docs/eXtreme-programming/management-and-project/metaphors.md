*"98% of our thinking is actually happening at an unconscious level, much of it through metaphors." - Esther Derby*

**In XP, the system metaphor** provides a common vision that helps the team and the client understand the elements of the system. Metaphors become a common language that helps the team understand and communicate complex concepts more simply. This promotes shared understanding and clarity within the team.

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a philosophy aimed at bridging the communication gap between technical and non-technical teams. Domain modeling principles can be applied alongside XP to help create a deeper understanding of client requirements and build systems that accurately reflect the problem domain. Metaphors, as long as they are known to both sides, can be used in code to make it more expressive.

**In summary,** "metaphors" in XP are a communication and shared understanding technique, while "DDD" is a design approach that can be used alongside XP to enhance domain modeling and system understanding. Both aim to improve software quality and customer satisfaction.
