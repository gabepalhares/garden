**With collective ownership,** any team member or pair can implement a feature, fix a bug, or refactor any part of the code at any time. In XP, everyone is responsible for the system. This encourages each team member to feel responsible for the overall quality.

**The original term** in the eXtreme Programming book is "collective ownership" rather than just "code ownership," because all artifacts in development are collectively owned by the team, not just the code.

**When ownership is not collective,** only one person owns the code, and programmers must submit it for review and approval.

**Collective ownership promotes** collaboration, code review, and more effective code maintenance, allowing the team to be more agile in delivering quality software. It reduces dependency on a single individual and creates a sense of shared responsibility.

### Sustainable Pace

**"Software development is a marathon, not a 100-meter sprint."**

**Long-term productivity is key.** Over a week or slightly more, the team may produce more by working extra hours. However, in the long run, this is unsustainable, as performance declines week after week.
