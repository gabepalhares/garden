### Intro

In the Y Career path, professionals can choose between advancing to a leadership position or opting to become a specialist in the technical area of a specific sector. If a professional has leadership aspirations, they can continue with their usual career plan, also refining their knowledge. There is a difference between the different levels in the individual contributor track in the Y career path; these are the levels that do not require you to act as a leader (here are my informal definitions for some of these levels):

### Junior

Solves small and well-defined problems. Generally receives guidance from more senior individuals. **Impact Level:** Project

### Mid-level

Solves small and reasonably well-defined problems. Generally does not need guidance. **Impact Level:** Project

### Senior

Solves larger and undefined problems. Usually collaborates with other team members to implement solutions. **Impact Level:** Team

### Staff/CTO

Identifies and breaks down problems that often require the involvement of multiple teams in the solution. Ensures that different parts of the solution will work well together. **Impact Level:** Organization/Cost Center

### Principal

Identifies and breaks down problems that often require the involvement of multiple organizations/cost centers in the solution. Tries to ensure that different parts of the solution will work well together. **Impact Level:** Company

### Distinguished

Identifies and breaks down problems that often require the involvement of multiple companies/research centers in the solution. Participates in groups that attempt to make different parts of the solution work well together. **Impact Level:** Industry

### Irony/Fellow

Does whatever they feel like. **Impact Level:** Solar System

**Question:** Let's take Golang as an example, born within Google. Can we say it came from researchers, distinguished individuals, and principals? Out-of-the-box demands of this type are also delegated as tasks to teams with seniors/plenos/juniors?

**Answer:** I don't know what levels Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer were at, but Ken Thompson was a Distinguished Engineer when they created Go, so that aligns with my definition. And yes, projects of this magnitude typically generate work for all levels in this pyramid :)
