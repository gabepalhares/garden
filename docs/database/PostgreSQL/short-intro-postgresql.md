### What it is?

It is a relational Database Management System (DBMS) that allows storing, querying, and manipulating data in numerous ways. Among its various differentiators is the PL/pgSQL language.

PL/pgSQL is a language that enables the construction of powerful programs for companies that need to manage tables with millions or billions of records, and therefore, learning this technology facilitates the work of those who manipulate the PostgreSQL DBMS.
