### What it is?

MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database program. It is designed to store and manage large volumes of data in a flexible and scalable manner. MongoDB uses a JSON-like format called BSON for storing data, which allows for the representation of complex data structures.

### What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses a structured schema and tables with rows and columns to organize and store data. NoSQL, on the other hand, encompasses various database technologies that do not rely on a fixed schema like SQL databases. NoSQL databases are often more flexible and can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. They are suitable for use cases where scalability, flexibility, and performance are essential, such as web applications, big data, and real-time analytics.

### What about PostgreSQL and MongoDB?

PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that follows the SQL standards closely. It offers features such as ACID compliance, transactions, and advanced indexing capabilities. PostgreSQL is well-suited for applications that require complex queries, strong consistency, and data integrity.

MongoDB, on the other hand, is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It offers high performance, horizontal scalability, and flexible schema design. MongoDB is often used in scenarios where there is a need for fast iteration, scalability, and handling of unstructured data.

In summary, PostgreSQL is a relational database suitable for applications with complex relationships and structured data, while MongoDB is a NoSQL database suitable for applications requiring high scalability, flexibility, and handling of unstructured or semi-structured data.
