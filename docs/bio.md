## About

I am a full stack developer and a lifelong computer science student, committed to developing products that add value to the customer and user. I work on providing solutions in both `frontend` and `backend` development, using technologies such as `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `React.js` and `Node.js`. Furthermore, I also have practical knowledge in `SQL` and `NoSQL` databases, such as `PostgreSQL` and `MongoDB`. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying `football`, `mountain biking` and living an `outdoor lifestyle`. I am set to graduate in june 2025 with a degree in `Systems Analysis and Development` from Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas). Currently residing in the countryside of `Minas Gerais, Brazil`, I am available for `remote work`, or hybrid work in Belo Horizonte area. Feel free to ask for any additional information.
