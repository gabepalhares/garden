## About

I'm a full stack developer and a lifelong computer science student, committed to developing products that add value to the customer and user. I work on providing solutions in both `frontend` and `backend` development, using technologies such as `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `React.js` and `Node.js`. Furthermore, I also have practical knowledge in `SQL` databases, like `PostgreSQL` and `SQLite`. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying `football`, `mountain biking` and living an `outdoor lifestyle`. I am set to graduate in june 2025 with a degree in `Systems Analysis and Development` from Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas). Currently residing in the countryside of `Minas Gerais, Brazil`. Feel free to ask for any additional information.
