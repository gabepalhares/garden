I\'m a full stack developer and a lifelong computer science student. You can also find me online using my nickname, minortypo, with a Shiba profile picture. I love Shibas! I always strive to actively engage in the concept of Learn in Public by sharing my knowledge with others through articles and code. This webpage is also one of my ways of doing that; g.arden was created based on the Zettelkasten idea, inspired by Sibelius and Biantris and their own versions. My aim is to consistently update here with everything I\'m studying, learning, and developing.","permalink":"/garden/intro"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
